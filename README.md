# User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Methodology

I changed many div elements within the file into semantic elements such as aside, nav, header and footer. I also changed a "h2" element at the bottom of the page into a "h4" element to ensure that I kept the hierarchy of headings going down the page. I added comments in the areas of the HTML the I changed. As a result of changing some of the elements in the HTML file, I also had to go into the CSS file and change some of the names in there to match the new names of the corresponding elements in the html file.
